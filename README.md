# UROCK-2022
# ESP32 Wifi 
The file ESP32 WIFI is the combined part of the main codes for the UROCK robot (Charpy) + WIFI part which is used to connect the data to a html server which enables us to see the data that needs to be observed by us such as the Yaw drift which allows us to see how much the robot drifts (left or right) as time goes by. This allows us to know when we should compensate with the yaw drift as the robot moves.

This web server was guided by MoThunderz from Youtube which demonstrates how and which library is needed to use in the code. Only Part 1 and Part 2 of the youtube link is used here for reference. You can follow these links to generate only wifi part of the codes.
